The following passages are partial summary of Danielle Dennette essay “Where am I?” : 
So far what I remember from the story is that the author(who's sitting on a chair, right in front of the vat where his brain is floating) tries to project what “he” in his brainless body is thinking -> on to the brain kept in the vat in the lab. 
He tries to question why he can’t see himself from the brain’s pov.
Where do his thoughts come from? 
After having done some mental exercises, he tried to be present in every place he can be(for example u can mentally be present at the corner of ur room, on top of your terrace), and all works well except “here” - the efforts go in vain not being able to find himself in the vat. 
Comes two new characters in to the plot - Yorick- his brain, Hamlet being his body seated on a chair. 
Now he questions the origin of the thought “where am i” - 
He began making a list of alternatives to go on an endeavour to find the spatial coordinates for this thought: 
Where hamlet goes there goes Dennett
Where Yorick goes there goes Dennett
Dennet is wherever he thinks he is

{Highlight : I just thought of something - the moment when I’d receive a damage to my brain or my head - I can’t either think straight or concentrate on something fully, to be more precise, I can’t concentrate on something at all except for a fleeting moment before it is swayed away.
I might be able to think but it might be more of a thinking fog.}

The third proposition emphasizes on what we might call a person’s point of view. And the location of pov is the location of the person. (Of Dennett in this case, not of hamlet). 
Given a few instances, the author proposed that with a bit of mental gymnastics people are able to shift back and forth themselves mentally - changing one's point of view.
